### [142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

**Notice** that you **should not modify** the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

#### 题解
如果链表有环，返回环的起点。  
使用快慢指针找到环的交点。将快指针指向头结点，满指针指向交点，每次移动一步，再次相遇的位置就是环的起点。
```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (fast == slow) {
                fast = head;
                while (fast != slow) {
                    fast = fast.next;
                    slow = slow.next;
                }
                return fast;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
